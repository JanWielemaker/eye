Retina performs controlled chaining with Euler path detection.

Controlled chaining is backward chaining for rules like HEAD :- BODY and
forward chaining for rules like BODY -: HEAD with HEAD being a conjunction.

Euler paths are roughly "don't step in your own steps" which is inspired by
what Leonhard Euler discovered in 1736 for the KÃ¶nigsberg Bridge Problem.
Retina sees the rule BODY -: HEAD as HEAD & NOT(BODY) => HEAD.

The core inferencing is done in Prolog and https://github.com/infradig/trealla
is an independent, compact, efficient Prolog interpreter written in plain-old C.

The test examples in this directory can be extended to produce/consume N3 data.
In their current form they all should produce 'true.'.

Run all the tests via
$ ./test
