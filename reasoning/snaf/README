For a short description of e:Scope see https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/log-rules.n3#L61

e:Scope a rdfs:Class;
    rdfs:comment "class of (context span) pairs where a context is a list of consulted URI's and a span is the deductive closure number";
    rdfs:subClassOf e:Tuple;
    e:tupleTypes (e:Context e:Number).
