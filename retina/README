The core inferencing is done in Prolog and https://github.com/infradig/trealla
is an independent, compact, efficient Prolog interpreter written in plain-old C.

The test examples in this directory can be extended to produce/consume N3 data.
In their current form they all should produce 'true.'.

Run all the tests via
$ ./test 'swipl -g halt'
$ ./test 'tpl --ns'
