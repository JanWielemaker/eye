The core inferencing is done in Prolog and https://github.com/infradig/trealla
is an independent, compact, efficient Prolog interpreter written in plain-old C.

The test examples in this directory can be extended to consume/produce N3 data.
In their current form they all should produce the triple '[] = "PASS".'

Run all the tests via
$ ./test
$ ./test "tpl -g halt"
