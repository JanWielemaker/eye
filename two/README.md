# Two

Two is targeting [EYE reasoning](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning) using [Scryer Prolog](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog) and [Trealla Prolog](https://github.com/infradig/trealla).  
Run the examples and test cases via
```
$ ./test scryer-prolog
$ ./test tpl
```
and the results should be like in [eye/two test results for Scryer Prolog](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/two/result/result-scryer-prolog.pl) and [eye/two test results for Trealla Prolog](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/two/result/result-tpl.pl).
