# TWO

TWO stands for "Trealla Works it Out" and it is targeting [EYE reasoning](https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning)  
using [Trealla Prolog](https://github.com/infradig/trealla), a compact, efficient Prolog interpreter written in plain-old C.  
Run the examples and test cases with [test script](https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/two/test).
